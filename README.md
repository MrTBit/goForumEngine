# goForumEngine

A simple back-end for a forum site, written in go and backed by a PosgreSQL database.
It contains jwt authentication and server-side validation utilizing REST endpoints with JSON payloads.

This project is not intended to be used as a production tool, but for my own tinkering and experimentation.
